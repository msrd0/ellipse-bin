# ellipse

Command that truncates and ellipses strings in a human-friendly way.

```
$ echo very long sentence |ellipse -n 12
very long seâ€¦
```

## Install from AUR (recommended)

This example uses `yay`, but you can use your favourite AUR helper instead.

```bash
yay -S ellipse
```

## Install via cargo

First, install rust/cargo:

```bash
sudo pacman -S rust
```

Then, install with cargo:

```bash
cargo install ellipse
```

This will only work if you have cargo's binary install directory added to your `$PATH`
variable.
